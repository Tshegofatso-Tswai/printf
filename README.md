# printf Project

This is a group project that is completed By Tshegofatso Tswai and Thabiso Aphane. The goal of this project is to write our own version of the `printf` function in C. The `printf` function is used to produce formatted output to the standard output stream (stdout).

## Tasks

The project includes various tasks that involve handling different conversion specifiers, flags, and modifiers used in the `printf` function. Some of the tasks are marked as "mandatory," while others are "advanced" and may involve more complex functionalities.

## Getting Started

1. The first task involves implementing the basic functionality of `printf`, handling `%c`, `%s`, and `%%` conversion specifiers.
2. The second task extends the functionality to handle `%d` and `%i` conversion specifiers.
3. Additional tasks involve handling custom conversion specifiers, such as `%b`, `%S`, `%p`, `%r`, and `%R`.
4. The advanced tasks cover handling flags like `+`, `space`, `#`, `0`, and `-`, as well as length modifiers like `l` and `h`.

## Conclusion

This project aims to develop a custom `printf` function, providing a deeper understanding of C programming, formatted output, and the concepts of pair programming and group projects. By adhering to the guidelines and concepts outlined in this project, we can enhance our coding and collaboration skills, delivering a well-structured and functional `printf` implementation.
